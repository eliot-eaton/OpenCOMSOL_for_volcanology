# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to OpenCOMSOL for Volcanology! This guide will help you get started quickly based on what you want to do.

## 🔍 I want to USE an existing model

1. **Browse the directories:**
   - [Published Models](./published_models/) - Complete, validated models from publications
   - [Unfinished Models](./unfinished_models/) - Work-in-progress models

2. **Find a model of interest:**
   - Check each directory's README for available models
   - Read the model's README.md for details

3. **Download and use:**
   - Download the `.mph` file and any supporting files
   - Open in COMSOL Multiphysics
   - Follow the usage instructions in the model's README
   - Cite the original publication if you use it in your research!

## 📤 I want to SHARE a published model

1. **Prepare your files:**
   - COMSOL model file (.mph)
   - Complete documentation
   - Parameter files
   - Example results

2. **Use the template:**
   - Copy [`templates/MODEL_README_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/MODEL_README_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Fill in all sections, especially citation information

3. **Submit:**
   - Fork the repository
   - Add your model to `published_models/your_model_name/`
   - Submit a Pull Request

**Detailed instructions:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 🚧 I want to SHARE a work-in-progress model

1. **Prepare your files:**
   - COMSOL model file(s)
   - Documentation of current status
   - List of known issues and goals

2. **Use the template:**
   - Copy [`templates/MODEL_README_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/MODEL_README_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Focus on "Current Status" and "Goals" sections
   - Indicate if you're seeking collaborators

3. **Submit:**
   - Fork the repository
   - Add your model to `unfinished_models/your_model_name/`
   - Submit a Pull Request

**Detailed instructions:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 💡 I have an IDEA for a model

1. **Use the idea template:**
   - Copy [`templates/IDEA_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/IDEA_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Describe your research question and approach
   - See [`model_ideas/example_magma_hydrothermal_interaction.md`](./model_ideas/example_magma_hydrothermal_interaction.md) for an example

2. **Submit:**
   - Option A: Fork, add to `model_ideas/`, submit Pull Request
   - Option B: Open a GitHub Issue with your idea

**Detailed instructions:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 🤝 I want to COLLABORATE

1. **Browse existing models:**
   - Check [Unfinished Models](./unfinished_models/) for models seeking collaboration
   - Check [Model Ideas](./model_ideas/) for concepts needing developers

2. **Reach out:**
   - Contact information is usually in the model's README
   - Comment on relevant GitHub Issues
   - Use GitHub Discussions for broader conversations

3. **Contribute:**
   - Follow the contribution guidelines
   - Coordinate with the original author
   - Be respectful and collaborative!

## 🐛 I found an ISSUE with a model

1. **Check the model's README:**
   - Known limitations may already be documented

2. **Report the issue:**
   - Open a GitHub Issue
   - Include: which model, what the problem is, COMSOL version
   - Be constructive and provide details

3. **Fix it yourself (optional):**
   - Fork the repository
   - Fix the issue
   - Submit a Pull Request with clear description

## 📚 I need MORE INFORMATION

- **Contribution guidelines:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Repository overview:** [README.md](./README.md)
- **Templates:** [templates/README.md](./templates/README.md)
- **License information:** [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

## ❓ I still have QUESTIONS

- Open a GitHub Issue with the "question" label
- Use GitHub Discussions for broader topics
- Check existing Issues and Discussions first

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- **For users:**
  - Always check COMSOL version compatibility
  - Read the full README before running models
  - Cite original publications in your work
  - Consider contributing improvements back

- **For contributors:**
  - More documentation is always better
  - Include example results
  - Test your model before submitting
  - Respond to questions about your models
  - Update models when you find improvements
