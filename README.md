# OpenCOMSOL for Volcanology

A collaborative repository for sharing COMSOL Multiphysics models related to volcanic processes and volcanology research.

## 🌋 About

This repository serves as a community hub for volcanologists and computational scientists to share, collaborate on, and discuss COMSOL models for volcanic systems. Whether you have published models, works in progress, or just ideas for future modeling efforts, this is the place to contribute!

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

### [Published Models](./published_models/)
Peer-reviewed and published COMSOL models associated with scientific publications. These models are complete, validated, and ready for use by the community.

### [Unfinished Models](./unfinished_models/)
Work-in-progress models currently under development. These models may be seeking feedback, collaboration, or are in various stages of completion.

### [Model Ideas](./model_ideas/)
Concepts and proposals for future COMSOL models. Share your research questions, discuss modeling approaches, and find collaborators.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Users
1. Browse the directories to find models of interest
2. Read the README in each model directory for specific information
3. Download model files (.mph) and associated documentation
4. Refer to the original publications for theoretical background

### For Contributors
1. Review our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
2. Choose the appropriate directory for your contribution
3. Follow the directory-specific submission guidelines
4. Submit a pull request or contact the maintainers
