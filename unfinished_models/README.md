# Unfinished Models

This directory contains work-in-progress COMSOL models related to volcanology that are still under development.

## Purpose

This space is for:
- Models currently being developed for future publication
- Exploratory models being tested and refined
- Models seeking community feedback and collaboration
- Educational models in development
- Models that never made it to publication

## Submission Guidelines

Models in this directory should include:
- Current state of development (e.g., "initial testing", "parameter calibration", "validation phase")
- Known issues or limitations
- Goals for completion
- Contact information for collaboration

## Directory Structure

Each model should be placed in its own subdirectory:

```
model_name/
├── README.md              # Model description, status, and goals
├── model_file.mph         # COMSOL model file(s)
├── notes.md               # Development notes and to-do items
└── preliminary_results/   # Current results (if available)
```

## Collaboration

Contributors are encouraged to:
- Provide feedback on models
- Suggest improvements
- Offer to collaborate
- Share relevant resources

Please contact the model author before making significant changes.
