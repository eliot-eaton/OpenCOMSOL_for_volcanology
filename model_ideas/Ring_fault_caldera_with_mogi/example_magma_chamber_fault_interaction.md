# Model Idea: ring-fault and magma chamber Interaction

**This is an example file to demonstrate the format. Feel free to delete it or use it as inspiration.**

## Research Question
How does including a ring-fault above a spherical magma chamber influence ground deformation? 

## Motivation
Understanding magma chamber-fault interactions is crucial for:
- interpretting ground deformation


## Proposed Approach

### Physics Modules
- [] Heat Transfer (conduction and convection)
- [] Porous Media Flow (Darcy flow in rock)
- [x] Structural Mechanics (stress changes, rock failure)
- [ ] Multiphase Flow (potential boiling)
- [ ] Chemical Reactions (alteration, optional)

### Key Processes to Model
1. Heat transfer from magma intrusion to surrounding rock
2. Convective circulation in hydrothermal system
3. Pressure evolution due to heating and phase changes
4. Potential rock deformation and permeability changes
5. Boiling and two-phase flow near intrusion

### Geometry and Domain
- 2D axisymmetric 
- Domain: ~2-5 km × ~2-5 km
- Includes magma  body (radius = 1000 m, depth 5000 m )
- Surrounding elastic rock 
- Crack used to model fault (options to add in friction model)


### Coupling Requirements
- 

## Key Challenges
- Unknown dimensions of fault and fault friction law


## Expected Outputs
- Ground Deformation

## Potential Applications
- Hazard assessment at active volcanoes with ring-faults

## Collaboration
- [x] Seeking collaborators

## Status
- [x] Just an idea
- [ ] Literature review in progress
- [ ] Proof-of-concept started
- [ ] Seeking funding

## Notes
This model would complement existing work on:
- Magma chamber deformation models
- Volcanic degassing models


Initial 2D axisymmetric model could provide proof-of-concept before expanding to full 3D.
