# Model Ideas

This directory is for sharing concepts and ideas for future COMSOL models related to volcanology.

## Purpose

Use this space to:
- Propose new modeling approaches
- Discuss volcanic phenomena that need better modeling
- Share research questions that could be addressed with COMSOL
- Find collaborators for new projects
- Brainstorm innovative applications of multiphysics modeling

## Submission Format

Ideas should be submitted as markdown files describing:
- The volcanic phenomenon or research question
- Potential physics modules needed (e.g., heat transfer, structural mechanics, fluid dynamics)
- Scientific motivation and applications
- Key challenges or considerations
- Relevant literature
- Your contact information (if seeking collaborators)

## File Naming

Use descriptive names for your idea files:
- `lava_lake_convection_modeling.md`
- `ash_plume_electrification.md`
- `hydrothermal_system_permeability_evolution.md`

## From Idea to Implementation

When an idea progresses to actual model development:
1. Move or copy relevant information to the `unfinished_models` directory
2. Update this file with a link to the new model location
3. Keep the original idea file for reference

## Discussion

For detailed discussions about ideas, please use the repository's Issues or Discussions features.

## How to Submit

Please see the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed submission guidelines.
